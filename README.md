# Third Life
This is a Third Life datapack created my me, inspired by Grian's Third Life series.

For a player size of 4 or above, I recommend a worldborder cap of 1000 for the best experience.

To start the game, have everyone on the server and run `/function thirdlife:init`.

This current version of Thirdlife has the Boogeyman partially implemented. The Boogeyman was introduced in Season 2 of Third Life known as Last Life.

To start the Boogeyman, run `/function thirdlife:boogeyinit`.
